# Voz é vida - VeV

Voz é vida is an aided Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) system. AAC is used by people who, some or all of the time, cannot rely on their speech. More specifically, aided AAC comprises communication boards with symbols (e.g., objects, pictures, photographs, line drawings, visual-graphic symbols, printed words, and traditional orthography) used to generate sounds.

The system name is a Brazilian Portuguese phrase meaning "Voice is life".

The software is focused on two types of users:
* People with impairments: use VeV mobile to communicate.
* Caregivers (therapists and parents): create and manage communication boards for their patients/relatives.
